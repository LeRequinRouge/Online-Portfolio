  My name is Drew Croteau and I'm a full-time student at California State University Fullerton. I'm a Computer Science major with an emphasis on Cybersecurity specialization. But enough about my curricular status: I love beer, hockey, and my girlfriend Leah (Not necessarily in that order...). I typically participate in outdoor activities like hiking, skateboarding, and all-around beach bummin'. That being said, however, I tend to shy away from social interaction with strangers or speaking in front of large groups. It's a work in a progress, but I feel as though I'm getting better at it.
